    lyrics: `
    We were both young when I first saw you
    I close my eyes and the flashback starts
    I'm standing there
    On a balcony, in summer air
    See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
    See you make your way through the crowd
    And say, "Hello"
    Little did I know
    That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
    And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
    And I was crying on the staircase
    Begging you, "Please don't go"
    And I said
    "Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
    I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
    You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
    It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
    So I sneak out to the garden to see you
    We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
    So close your eyes
    Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
    'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
    And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
    But you were everything to me
    I was begging you, "Please don't go"
    And I said
    "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
    I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
    You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
    It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
    Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
    This love is difficult, but it's real
    Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
    It's a love story, baby, just say yes
    Oh, oh-oh
    I got tired of waiting
    Wondering if you were ever coming around
    My faith in you was fading
    When I met you on the outskirts of town
    And I said
    "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
    I keep waiting for you, but you never come
    Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
    He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
    And said
    "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
    I love you, and that's all I really know
    I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
    It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
    Oh, oh-oh
    Oh, oh-oh, oh
    'Cause we were both young when I first saw you`,

I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me, and I see there's something you're trying to hide, and I
Reach for your hand but it's cold, you pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind

And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble, and your voice begins to break, you say
The cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's, they were my mate's
And I feel the color draining from my face

And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright"

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on

But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just want to stay

And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go"

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go

It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright`,

Wise men say
Only fools, only fools rush in
Oh, but I, but I, I can't help falling in love with you

Shall I stay?
Would it be, would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you
    
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things, you know, are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can"t help falling in love with you
For I can"t help falling in love with you
Yeah`,
