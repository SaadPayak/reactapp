    We were both young when I first saw you
    I close my eyes and the flashback starts
    I'm standing there
    On a balcony, in summer air
    See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
    See you make your way through the crowd
    And say, "Hello"
    Little did I know
    That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
    And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
    And I was crying on the staircase
    Begging you, "Please don't go"
    And I said
    "Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
    I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
    You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
    It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
    So I sneak out to the garden to see you
    We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
    So close your eyes
    Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
    'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
    And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
    But you were everything to me
    I was begging you, "Please don't go"
    And I said
    "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
    I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
    You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
    It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
    Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
    This love is difficult, but it's real
    Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
    It's a love story, baby, just say yes
    Oh, oh-oh
    I got tired of waiting
    Wondering if you were ever coming around
    My faith in you was fading
    When I met you on the outskirts of town
    And I said
    "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
    I keep waiting for you, but you never come
    Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
    He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
    And said
    "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
    I love you, and that's all I really know
    I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
    It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
    Oh, oh-oh
    Oh, oh-oh, oh
    'Cause we were both young when I first saw you`,

I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me, and I see there's something you're trying to hide, and I
Reach for your hand but it's cold, you pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind

And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble, and your voice begins to break, you say
The cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's, they were my mate's
And I feel the color draining from my face

And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright"

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on

But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just want to stay

And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go"

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go

It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright

    Usually never cry at all
    I would say I'm pretty tough

    And not think of you once
    But if they start playin' that song
    I can't help but to think about us, oh

    Really thought I'd be done with the hardest part
    When I pulled myself out of your arms
    Wish I knew that was only the start
    And now I'm fallin' apart 'cause

    Last night for the very first time
    You didn't even try to call
    Oh, I won't lie, I thought I might die
    I couldn't even sleep at all
    And maybe I'll get used to it (ah, ah)
    But right now I just feel like shit (ah, ah)
    Oh, oh

    So I kissed somebody else
    Just to see how it felt
    But all that was goin' through my brain
    Was your hands around my waist
    You know how to do it so well

    Really thought I was done with the hardest part

    Now if I get a little too drunk
    I'll start thinkin', "What if you were the one?"
    I know that the damage is done
    And I still have the shirt that you wore
    When we first met, it's there on the floor
    I might kick it under the bed
    Hopin' that I could forget that

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know, I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you

And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed you meant it when you said it first to me?

And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better

I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh

I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

      lyrics: `
      We were both young when I first saw you
      I close my eyes and the flashback starts
      I'm standing there
      On a balcony, in summer air
      See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
      See you make your way through the crowd
      And say, "Hello"
      Little did I know
      That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
      And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
      And I was crying on the staircase
      Begging you, "Please don't go"
      And I said
      "Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
      I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
      You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
      It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
      So I sneak out to the garden to see you
      We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
      So close your eyes
      Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
      'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
      And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
      But you were everything to me
      I was begging you, "Please don't go"
      And I said
      "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
      I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
      You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
      It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
      Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
      This love is difficult, but it's real
      Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
      It's a love story, baby, just say yes
      Oh, oh-oh
      I got tired of waiting
      Wondering if you were ever coming around
      My faith in you was fading
      When I met you on the outskirts of town
      And I said
      "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
      I keep waiting for you, but you never come
      Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
      He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
      And said
      "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
      I love you, and that's all I really know
      I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
      It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
      Oh, oh-oh
      Oh, oh-oh, oh
      'Cause we were both young when I first saw you`,

  I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
  You look away from me, and I see there's something you're trying to hide, and I
  Reach for your hand but it's cold, you pull away again
  And I wonder what's on your mind
  
  And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
  You start to tremble, and your voice begins to break, you say
  The cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's, they were my mate's
  And I feel the color draining from my face
  
  And my friend said
  "I know you love her, but it's over, mate
  It doesn't matter, put the phone away
  It's never easy to walk away, let her go
  It'll be alright"
  
  So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
  And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
  And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
  And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
  
  But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
  It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
  And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
  But I just want to stay
  
  And my friend said
  "I know you love her, but it's over, mate
  It doesn't matter, put the phone away
  It's never easy to walk away, let her go
  It'll be okay
  It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
  So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
  You'll find another and you'll be just fine
  Let her go"
  
  But nothing heals the past like time
  And they can't steal
  The love you're born to find
  But nothing heals the past like time
  And they can't steal
  The love you're born to find
  
  I know you love her, but it's over, mate
  It doesn't matter, put the phone away
  It's never easy to walk away, let her go
  It'll be okay
  It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
  So bottoms up, let's forget tonight

      Usually never cry at all
      I would say I'm pretty tough
      But it's been a couple weeks now
      And I still feel stuck in my lungs
      And usually I go out on nights
      And not think of you once
      But if they start playin' that song
      I can't help but to think about us, oh

      Really thought I'd be done with the hardest part
      When I pulled myself out of your arms
      Wish I knew that was only the start
      And now I'm fallin' apart 'cause

      Last night for the very first time
      You didn't even try to call
      Oh, I won't lie, I thought I might die
      I couldn't even sleep at all
      And maybe I'll get used to it (ah, ah)
      But right now I just feel like shit (ah, ah)
      Oh, oh

      So I kissed somebody else
      Just to see how it felt
      But all that was goin' through my brain
      Was your hands around my waist
      You know how to do it so well

      Really thought I was done with the hardest part
      When I pulled myself out of your arms
      Wish I knew that was only the start
      And now I'm fallin' apart 'cause

      Last night for the very first time
      You didn't even try to call (you didn't even try to call)
      Oh, I won't lie, I thought I might die
      I couldn't even sleep at all
      And maybe I'll get used to it (ah, ah)
      But right now I just feel like shit (ah, ah)
      Oh, oh

      Now if I get a little too drunk
      I'll start thinkin', "What if you were the one?"
      I know that the damage is done
      And I still have the shirt that you wore
      When we first met, it's there on the floor
      I might kick it under the bed
      Hopin' that I could forget that

      Last night for the very first time
      You didn't even try to call
      Oh, I won't lie, I thought I might die
      I couldn't even sleep at all
      And maybe I'll get used to it (ah, ah)
